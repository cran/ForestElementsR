#' Get the Area in ha of a Compatible Object
#'
#' The function \code{get_area_ha} will return the correct area for all
#' appropriate objects provided by **ForestElementsR**. While the
#' \code{\link{fe_stand}} class contains this information directly, this is not
#' the case for the \code{\link{fe_stand_spatial}} class. However,
#' \code{get_area_ha} will work for both (and other objects to be implemented)
#' in the same way. In case the object \code{x} does not contain sufficient
#' information, the function returns NULL.
#'
#' @param x Object provided by **ForestElementsR** for which an area can be
#'   meaningfully given, typically \code{\link{fe_stand}} or
#'   \code{\link{fe_stand_spatial}}
#'
#' @return The object's area in ha. In case the object \code{x} does not contain
#'   sufficient information, the function returns NULL.
