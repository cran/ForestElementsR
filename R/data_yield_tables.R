#' Yield Tables
#'
#' @description The yield table system of **ForestElementsR** allows easy use
#' of yield tables that are available as an \code{\link{fe_yield_table}} object.
#' Here, we list all yield tables that come with the current version of the
#' package. For test purposes and as an example, the Scots Pine table by
#' Wiedemann (1943) is provided as a raw data frame (prefix "ytable_") and an
#' \code{fe_yield_table} object (prefix "fe_ytable_"). The raw data frame can be
#' transformed into a \code{fe_yield_table} object with the function
#' \code{\link{fe_yield_table}} (see the example there).
#' When we refer to *Schober's yield table collection* below, we mean
#' \insertCite{ertragstafeln_schober_1975;textual}{ForestElementsR}. Many of
#' the yield tables listed were implemented in the version published in what we
#' refer to as the *Hilfstafeln edited by the Bavarian Forest Administration*.
#' Hereby, we mean, more precisely,
#' \insertCite{hilfstafeln_bavaria_1990;textual}{ForestElementsR}, and
#' \insertCite{hilfstafeln_bavaria_2018;textual}{ForestElementsR}. The yield
#' table collection in both editions is almost identical, and represented
#' in  **ForestElementsR** (including error corrections beyond the 2018
#' edition). Only the yield table by Kenk and Hradetzky for Douglas fir that is
#' new in the 2018 hasn't been imported here, yet.
#'
#' The following yield tables are currently implemented (alphabetically ordered
#' by author names):
#'
#' \itemize{
#'  \item{*Assmann-Franz 1963, Norway Spruce, Mean Yield Level*: Imported from
#'  the "Hilfstafeln" edited by the Bavarian Forest Administration. The total
#'  volume production (tvp), mean annual increment (mai), and the periodic
#'  annual increment were given as reduced values (under bark, harvest losses
#'  substracted) only. Thus, they were converted into standing mÂ³ over bark
#'  by dividing them by 0.81 (standard factor for Norway spruce in Bavaria). The
#'  yield table allows site indexing based on the dominant height h100, and the
#'  quadratic mean height hq, whereby the former is the way Ernst Assmann and
#'  Friedrich Franz had in mind. The site index of this table is, unusual for
#'  German yield tables, given as a stand's expected dominant height at an age
#'  of 100 years. Unlike in most yield table, the number of removal trees
#'  (n_rmv_ha), the volume of the removal stand (v_rmv_ha), and the periodic
#'  annual increment (pai_m3_ha_yr, red_m3_ha_yr) relate to the subsequent, not
#'  the previous time span. Variables whose names begin with "red_" relate to
#'  harvested volume under bark; i.e. reduced by 19 % which takes into account
#'  both, harvest losses (mainly stump) and bark volume.}
#'
#'  \item{*Bauer, 1955, Red Oak*: Imported from the "Hilfstafeln" edited by the
#'  Bavarian Forest Administration. In the source files, the quadratic mean
#'  height of the site index classes was only available as lower threshold
#'  (i.e 1/4 site index lower). So the original heights were taken from the
#'  version published in Schober's (1975) yield table collection for the whole
#'  site indexes (I.0, II.0, etc.). The values for the site indexes I.5 and II.5
#'  were generated by linear inter- and extrapolation. The total volume
#'  production was not contained in the Bavarian edition of the table; so, it
#'  was added from the version published in Schober's (1975) collection.
#'  The table follows the standard structure of all tables that are part of the
#'  Bavarian "Hilfstafeln": Stem number, mean diameter, standing volume, and
#'  basal area describe the remaining stand. Wood volume means is defined as
#'  standing coarse wood over bark. Variables whose names begin with "red_"
#'  relate to harvested volume under bark; i.e. reduced by 21 % which takes
#'  into account both, harvest losses (mainly stump) and bark volume.}
#'
#'  \item{*Blume, 1949, Poplar*: Imported from the "Hilfstafeln" edited
#'  by the Bavarian Forest Administration. Originally, this table was designed
#'  for site indexing by quadratic mean diameter (d_q_cm), not by height.
#'  Therefore, this diameter was given in the table as lower threshold, here
#'  listed as "d_q_cm_si_plus_025". As site indexing by height is always
#'  preferable, options for site indexing by both, diameter and height, were
#'  included in the fe_yield_table representation of this table.
#'  The actual quadratic mean diameter (d_q_cm) which is used for site indexing
#'  if the user decides so was calculated from dividing the given basal area
#'  by the stem number, multiplying it with 4/pi, and taking the square root of
#'  the result. The total volume production (tvp) was not contained in the
#'  Bavarian edition of the table. Therefore, it was re-calculated by
#'  multiplying the table's mean annual increment (mai) with the stand age.
#'  Despite the lower diameter threshold for site indexing, the table follows
#'  the standard structure of all tables that are part of the Bavarian
#'  "Hilfstafeln": Stem number, mean diameter, standing volume, and basal area
#'  describe the remaining stand. Wood volume means is defined as standing
#'  coarse wood over bark. Variables whose names begin with "red_" relate to
#'  harvested volume under bark; i.e. reduced by 19 % which takes into account
#'  both, harvest losses (mainly stump) and bark volume.
#'  Overall, this table seems not really well constructed, the time-curves of
#'  its variables are often not intuitively plausible. Some inconsistencies
#'  (e.g. decreasing tvp resulting from a to low mean annual increment value)
#'  were corrected.}

#'  "Hilfstafeln" edited by the Bavarian Forest Administration. in the source
#'  files, the quadratic mean height of the site index classes was only

#'  quadratic mean diameter (d_q_cm) for site index 2.0 was obviously wrong
#'  in the source data. It was corrected by interpolation.}
