	abstract = {Single tree forest growth simulators have proven to be very flexible tools for predicting forest growth. They are commonly applied in the United States but they are rarely used in European forest management yet. One of the few exceptions is the simulator SILVA, which is presented in this paper. The underlying equations of this simulator are developed from a set of more than 155,000 tree observations, including the species Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.), Silver fir (Abies alba Mill.), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), Common beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) and Sessile oak (Quercus petraea (Mattuschka) Liebl.). These basic model equations are presented together with respective parameter values, derived from the aforesaid data set. The benefits of SILVA for forest practice, research, and education are demonstrated with three exemplary applications. Evaluation in terms of biological plausibility, validation, and practical use of the implemented software is presented, which shows that: (1) biological principles could be represented without explicitly being implemented, and (2) the simulation results are very close to independent observations as far as the range of parameterized site conditions is not exceeded. Furthermore, possible implications of changing conditions or an application of the model across a wider geographical range are discussed with special reference to the ongoing process of parameterization.},

	abstract = {The self-thinning rule established by Reineke in 1933, N α d
−1.605 (N, d = number of stems and quadratic mean diameter, respectively) assumes the same allometric relationship between size and density for a wide spectrum of species
under self-thinning conditions. We re-evaluate this rule based on 28 fully stocked pure stands of common beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), Norway spruce (Picea abies [L.] Karst.), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), and common oak (Quercus petraea [Mattuschka] Liebl.) in
Germany that date back to the year 1870. OLS regression of the model ln(N) = a + b · ln(d) results in b values of −1.789 for common beech, −1.664 for Norway spruce, −1.593 for Scots pine, and −1.424 for common oak.
The allometric coefficient for common beech differs significantly from the other species. There is also a significant difference between the b values of Norway spruce and common oak. Except for Scots pine, the above allometric coefficients deviate significantly (common beech) and close-to-significantly
(Norway spruce, common oak) from the coefficient −1.605 postulated by Reineke in 1933. To cover the species–specific oscillation of mortality rates, we additionally calculate the self-thinning coefficient for each survey period. Ecological implications of the species-specific scaling
exponents are stressed and consequences regarding tools for regulating stand density are discussed. FOR. SCI. 51(4):304–320.},

	shorttitle = {Forest {Dynamics}, {Growth} and {Yield}},
	abstract = {The aim of this book is to improve the understanding of forest dynamics and the sustainable management of forest ecosystems. How do tree crowns, trees or entire forest stands respond to thinning in the long term? What effect do tree species mixtures and multi-layering have on the productivity and stability of trees, stands or forest enterprises? How do tree and stand growth respond to stress factors such as climate change or air pollution? Furthermore, in the event that one has acquired knowledge about the effects of thinning, mixture and stress, how can one make that knowledge applicable to decision-making in forestry practice? The experimental designs, analytical methods, general relationships and models for answering questions of this kind are the focus of this book. Given the structures dealt with, which range from plant organs to the tree, stand and enterprise levels, and the processes analysed in a time frame of days or months to decades or even centuries, this book is directed at all readers interested in trees, forest stands and forest ecosystems. This work has been compiled for students, scientists, lecturers, forest planners, forest managers, and consultants.},
